# Example of use

## Basic use

You could first create the acceptance model

```python
from gammapy.maps import MapAxis
from gammapy.data import DataStore
from regions import CircleSkyRegion
import astropy.units as u
import numpy as np
from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
from baccmod import RadialAcceptanceMapCreator

# The observations to use for creating the acceptance model
data_store = DataStore.from_dir("$GAMMAPY_DATA/hess-dl3-dr1")
obs_collection = data_store.get_observations([23523, 23526, 23559, 23592])

# The exclusion regions to apply during acceptance model calculation
exclude_regions = [CircleSkyRegion(center=SkyCoord.from_name('Crab'),
                                   radius=0.2 * u.deg), ]

# Define the binning of the model
e_min, e_max = 0.1 * u.TeV, 10. * u.TeV
size_fov = 2.5 * u.deg
offset_axis_acceptance = MapAxis.from_bounds(0. * u.deg, size_fov, nbin=6, name='offset')
energy_axis_acceptance = MapAxis.from_energy_bounds(e_min, e_max, nbin=6, name='energy')

acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions,
                                                      oversample_map=10)
acceptance_model = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map(obs_collection)

```

You can then check the acceptance model by plotting it using

```python
acceptance_model.peek()
```

To use it with gammapy, you could first save it on a FITS file

```python
hdu_acceptance = acceptance_model.to_table_hdu()
hdu_acceptance.writeto('acceptance.fits', overwrite=True)
```

It's then possible to load the acceptance model in the current gammapy DataStore with this code.
You would need then to recreate you gammapy Observations object in order than the acceptance model is taken into account for the analysis.

```python
data_store.hdu_table.remove_rows(data_store.hdu_table['HDU_TYPE']=='bkg')
for obs_id in np.unique(data_store.hdu_table['OBS_ID']):
    data_store.hdu_table.add_row({'OBS_ID': obs_id, 
                                 'HDU_TYPE': 'bkg',
                                 "HDU_CLASS": "bkg_2d",
                                 "FILE_DIR": "",
                                 "FILE_NAME": 'acceptance.fits',
                                 "HDU_NAME": "BACKGROUND",
                                 "SIZE": hdu_acceptance.size})
data_store.hdu_table = data_store.hdu_table.copy()

obs_collection = data_store.get_observations([23523, 23526, 23559, 23592])

data_store.hdu_table
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Due to some change in gammapy 1.3, it's strongly suggested to use only use models that have been created with the same version of gammapy used


## Telescope position

**The observations should contain the telescope position in order to have the algorithm working.**
If the information is missing in the DL3, you could either add it or it possible to add it directly to the observation as shown in the example below.
```python
from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation

# Your telescope position in an EarthLocation object
loc = EarthLocation.of_site('Roque de los Muchachos')

# Add telescope position to observations
for i in obs_collection:
    obs_collection[i].obs_info['GEOLON'] = loc.lon.value
    obs_collection[i].obs_info['GEOLAT'] = loc.lat.value
    obs_collection[i].obs_info['GEOALT'] = loc.height.value
    obs_collection[i]._location = loc
```

## Runwise norm of the model 

It's also possible to fit the normalisation of the model per run. For this use the method create_acceptance_map_per_observation .
In that case the output is a dictionary containing the acceptance model of each observations (with the observation Id as index).
```python
acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions,
                                                      oversample_map=10)
acceptance_models = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map_per_observation(obs_collection)
```

## Zenith binned model

It's also possible to create model binned per cos zenith. For this use the method create_acceptance_map_per_observation but with the option `zenith_binning` set at True.
The width of zenith bin could be control at the creation of the object with the parameter `initial_cos_zenith_binning`.
You can chose the `cos_zenith_binning_method`: `min_livetime` or `min_n_observation`  to give a condition on minimum livetime or number of observations for each bin. The algorithm will then automatically rebin to larger bin in order to have in each bin at least `cos_zenith_binning_parameter_value` livetime (in seconds) or observation per bin. If you add `_per_wobble` to the method name, wobbles will be identified and the binning will require the condition to be fulfilled for each identified wobble.
In that case the output is a dictionary containing the acceptance model of each observations (with the observation ID as index).
Set `verbose` to True to get the binning result and a plot of the binned livetime.
```python
acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions,
                                                      oversample_map=10,
                                                      cos_zenith_binning_method='min_livetime_per_wobble',
                                                      cos_zenith_binning_parameter_value=3600,
                                                      initial_cos_zenith_binning=0.01,
                                                      verbose=True)
acceptance_models = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map_per_observation(obs_collection,
                                                                                   zenith_binning=True)
```

## Zenith interpolated model

It's also possible to create model interpolated between the binned model per cos zenith. For this use the method create_acceptance_map_per_observation but with the option `zenith_interpolation` set at True. All the parameters controlling the cos zenith binning remain active.
```python
acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions,
                                                      oversample_map=10,
                                                      min_run_per_cos_zenith_bin=3,
                                                      initial_cos_zenith_binning=0.01)
acceptance_models = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map_per_observation(obs_collection,
                                                                                   zenith_binning=True,
                                                                                   zenith_interpolation=True)
```

## Using OFF runs for background model

It is also possible to create a model from OFF runs and to apply in ON runs you want to analyse. The exclusions regions should cover potential sources both in the ON and OFF runs at the same time. The OFF runs don't need to be spatially connected.
```python
acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions,
                                                      oversample_map=10,
                                                      min_run_per_cos_zenith_bin=3,
                                                      initial_cos_zenith_binning=0.01)
acceptance_models = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map_per_observation(obs_collection,
                                                                                   off_observations=obs_collection_off,
                                                                                   zenith_binning=True,
                                                                                   zenith_interpolation=True)
```

## Store background model for later application

It could be in some case useful to precompute a model and to apply it on data later. The example below cover the case where you want to use a model per run using zenith interpolation and OFF runs.

However, it's possible to use this functionality without OFF runs or zenith interpolation. In the last case you just need to provide a model in a gammapy format.

There are at this stage no define file format for storing the intermediate results, we suggest to store the BackgroundCollectionZenith object created directly using pickle.

### Creating the model

The example below creates the `BackgroundCollectionZenith` object containing the zenith binned model.
The `obs_collection` provided could either be your ON runs if you want to compute background directly from the data or OFF runs if you want to use other data for the background model.

```python
acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions,
                                                      oversample_map=10,
                                                      min_run_per_cos_zenith_bin=3,
                                                      initial_cos_zenith_binning=0.01)
base_model = acceptance_model_creator.create_model_cos_zenith_binned(obs_collection)
```

### Storing and loading a model with pickle

The `BackgroundCollectionZenith` object containing the models could then be store using pickle.
```python
import pickle
with open('my_bkg_model.pck', mode='wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(base_model, f)
```

It is then possible to retrieve it later using pickle.
```python
import pickle
with open('my_bkg_model.pck', mode='rb') as f:
    base_model = pickle.load(f)
```

### Applying a model in memory

When you have a precomputed model in memory, it is possible to apply it directly on a given set of runs by using the `base_mode` parameter.
```python
acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions)
acceptance_models = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map_per_observation(obs_collection,
                                                                                   base_model=base_model,
                                                                                   zenith_binning=True,
                                                                                   zenith_interpolation=True)
```

## Compute background model with a higher time resolution than the observation run

If the background evolve quickly, like at high zenith angle, you could compute in the case of zenith binned or interpolated background the model at a smaller time scale than the observation run. The background model for the run will then correspond to the average of all the model computed for each part of the run.
It should improve accuracy of the model at the expanse of a larger compute time.
For this you need to set `use_mini_irf_computation = True` and you could control the time resolution used for computation with the parameter `mini_irf_time_resolution`.

```python
acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                      offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                      exclude_regions=exclude_regions,
                                                      oversample_map=10,
                                                      min_run_per_cos_zenith_bin=3,
                                                      initial_cos_zenith_binning=0.01,
                                                      use_mini_irf_computation = True,
                                                      mini_irf_time_resolution = 1. * u.min)
acceptance_models = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map_per_observation(obs_collection,
                                                                                   zenith_binning=True,
                                                                                   zenith_interpolation=True)
```

# Available model

All models have an identical interface. You just need to change the class used to change the model created.

There are two model currently available :

- A 2D model with hypothesis of a radial symmetry of the background across the FoV. This is the class `RadialAcceptanceMapCreator`.
    ````python
    from baccmod import RadialAcceptanceMapCreator
    acceptance_model_creator = RadialAcceptanceMapCreator(energy_axis_acceptance,
                                                          offset_axis_acceptance,
                                                          exclude_regions=exclude_regions)
    acceptance_models = acceptance_model_creator.create_acceptance_map_per_observation(obs_collection)
